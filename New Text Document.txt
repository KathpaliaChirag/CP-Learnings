A. Integer Sequence Dividing
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
You are given an integer sequence 1,2,…,n
. You have to divide it into two sets A
 and B
 in such a way that each element belongs to exactly one set and |sum(A)−sum(B)|
 is minimum possible.

The value |x|
 is the absolute value of x
 and sum(S)
 is the sum of elements of the set S
.

Input
The first line of the input contains one integer n
 (1≤n≤2⋅109
).

Output
Print one integer — the minimum possible value of |sum(A)−sum(B)|
 if you divide the initial sequence 1,2,…,n
 into two sets A
 and B
.

Note
Some (not all) possible answers to examples:

In the first example you can divide the initial sequence into sets A={1,2}
 and B={3}
 so the answer is 0
.

In the second example you can divide the initial sequence into sets A={1,3,4}
 and B={2,5}
 so the answer is 1
.

In the third example you can divide the initial sequence into sets A={1,4,5}
 and B={2,3,6}
 so the answer is 1
.

CODE :
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
long n; long long s1;
cin>>n;

if(n>=1 && n<= 2000000000)
{
if(n%2==0)    
s1=(n/2)*(n+1);
else
s1=(n)*((n+1)/2);
cout<<(s1%2);
}
}
